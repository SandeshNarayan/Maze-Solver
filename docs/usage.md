    Running the Maze Solver

        Once you have installed the Maze Solver project, follow these steps to use it effectively.

        1. Start the Application

            To launch the Maze Solver, navigate to the project directory and run:

            python3 main.py

        2. Interacting with the Maze

            A window will open displaying the maze.

            The maze is generated dynamically based on the set parameters.

            The solver will attempt to find a path from the entrance to the exit.

        3. Customizing the Maze

            You can modify the maze properties by editing the relevant parameters in the code:

            Grid Size: Adjust the number of rows and columns.

            Wall Configuration: Change how walls are placed or removed.

            Solver Algorithm: Modify the pathfinding approach to test different solving methods.

        4. Exiting the Application

            To close the application, simply close the window, or use Ctrl + C in the terminal.

    Troubleshooting

        If the application does not launch, ensure all dependencies are installed.

        If the window does not display properly, try resizing it manually or restarting the script.

        Check the console for error messages and follow any instructions provided.
